# Image Captioning with LSTM Seq2Seq

## Overview
This project implements an image captioning model using a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture. The model generates textual descriptions of images, leveraging deep learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing.

## Features
- Uses a CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for feature extraction from images.
- Implements an LSTM-based Seq2Seq model for text generation.
- Trains on a dataset of images with corresponding captions.
- Supports attention mechanisms to enhance captioning accuracy.
- Uses pre-trained word embeddings for better language modeling.

## Dataset
The notebook is designed to work with datasets containing image-caption pairs, such as:
- MS COCO
- Flickr8k/Flickr30k
- Custom datasets with appropriate formatting

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib nltk tqdm pillow


Additional dependencies may be required based on the dataset and preprocessing needs.

## Usage
1. *Prepare the dataset:*
   - Ensure image-caption pairs are available in a structured format.
   - Preprocess the text data (tokenization, padding, etc.).
   
2. *Extract Features:*
   - Load a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to extract image features.

3. *Train the Seq2Seq Model:*
   - Train the LSTM-based decoder on the preprocessed captions.
   - Optionally, use an attention mechanism to improve performance.

4. *Generate Captions:*
   - Use the trained model to generate captions for new images.

## Results & Evaluation
- Model performance can be evaluated using BLEU scores.
- Visualize generated captions alongside images to assess quality.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement Transformer-based architectures for improved performance.
- Experiment with different attention mechanisms.
- Train on larger datasets for better generalization.
